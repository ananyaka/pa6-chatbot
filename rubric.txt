TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?


Response - Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems would mean that humans would not only start believing the system's advice,
but would also start sharing personal/sensitive information with these chatbots without realizing that what they share
could possibly be accessed by other people as well. This is a big privacy issue right here.
In addition to this, when people start believing whatever the system says, they could get emotionally hurt, could do things
they shouldn't be doing etc. (we have no idea what data these chatbots migt be trained on and the extent of harm they can do with
their words).

A great way to distinguish chatbot responses from those of a human might be to add specific questions that are programmed to be answered
by the bot with a specific answer only. Like are you a bot? A bot would always respond yes to this.
